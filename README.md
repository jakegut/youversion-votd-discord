# youversion-votd-discord
A discord bot that pulls from [YouVersion's Verse of the Day API](https://developers.youversion.com/), written in Python.

### About the images folder...
The images returned from the api are stored in the images folder in a .png format 500x500 pixels wide, Discord embeds doesn't like images from proxies too much. Images are only downloaded if it's brand new. Hopefully this is a temporary fix.
